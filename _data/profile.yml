bio: "Hi, I'm Hayden! I am currently an PhD student at UCSD studying Computer Science and Engineering. I am part of [Sandy Research Lab](https://sandyresearch.github.io/) and advised by Dan Fu and Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick. I am originally from Austin, Texas and previously did by undergraduate at University of Texas at Austin. My primary interests are core machine learning and computer systems!"
research: "My research mostly covers the intersection of ML and systems, including SSMs, structured sparsity, and all things GPU. I am broadly interested in developing an understanding of how we can better interpret and exploit sparsity to improve the efficiency and expressivity of large models."
