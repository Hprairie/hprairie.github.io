    title: "CSE PhD @ University of California, San Diego",
    bio: "Hi, I'm Hayden! I am currently an PhD student at UCSD studying Computer Science and Engineering. I am originally from Austin, Texas and previously did by undergraduate at University of Texas at Austin. My primary interests are core machine learning and computer systems!",
    research: "My research mostly covers the intersection of ML and systems, including SSMs, structured sparsity, and all things GPU. I am broadly interested in developing an understanding of how we can better interpret and exploit sparsity to improve into the efficiency of expressivity of large models.",
    work: "Please check out my GitHub to see what I am currently working on and the projects I have contributed to!",
